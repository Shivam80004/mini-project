Bali was winning, and Indra was becoming increasingly frustrated. In a fit of rage, Indra threw the Sudarshan Chakra at Bali, cutting off his head. Bali's body fell to the ground, but his head continued to fly through the air. Indra chased after it, but the head was too fast for him. Finally, Indra gave up and returned to heaven.\n\nThe head of Bali landed in the village of Puri, where it was found by a fisherman named Sudarshan. Sudarshan took the head to his home and placed it on a banana leaf. The next morning, he found that the head had turned into a beautiful statue of Vishnu. Sudarshan realized that this was a sign from the gods, and he built a temple to house the statue. This temple is the Jagannath Temple, which is still standing today.\n\n**The Jagannath Temple Today**\n\nThe Jagannath Temple is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India.

It is believed to have been built by King Pushkar in the 10th century CE. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deities Lakshmi and Narayan, who are depicted as a seated couple on a lotus flower. The temple is a beautiful example of Rajasthani architecture, with its intricate carvings and colorful paintings. It is also a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus, who come to worship Lakshmi and Narayan and to seek their blessings.\n\n* **Significance in Hinduism**\n\nThe Laxmi Narayan Temple is one of the most important temples in Hinduism. It is believed to be one of the few temples where Lakshmi and Narayan are worshipped together. This is significant because Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth and prosperity, while Narayan is the god of protection and salvation. Together, they represent the two essential aspects of the Hindu quest for moksha, or liberation from the cycle of rebirth.\n\n* **Legends**\n\nThere are many legends associated with the Laxmi Narayan Temple. One legend tells the story of how the temple was built. King Pushkar was a great devotee of Lakshmi and Narayan. He wanted to build a temple in their honor, but he did not know where to start. One day, he was meditating in the forest when he saw a vision of Lakshmi and Narayan. They told him that he should build the temple on the spot where he had seen them. King Pushkar did as they said, and the temple was built.\n\nAnother legend tells the story of how the temple was saved from destruction. In the 16th century, the Mughal emperor Akbar invaded Rajasthan. He ordered that all of the Hindu temples in the region be destroyed. When Akbar's soldiers came to Pushkar, they were about to destroy the Laxmi Narayan Temple when they were stopped by a miracle. A large cobra appeared and coiled itself around the temple, protecting it from harm. The soldiers were so scared that they ran away. The cobra remained at the temple for many years, guarding it from harm.\n\n* **Present Day**\n\nThe Laxmi Narayan Temple is still a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus today. It is also a popular tourist destination, and is one of the most visited temples in Rajasthan. The temple is open to all visitors, regardless of their religion or beliefs.\n\n**References**\n\n* [Laxmi Narayan Temple, Pushkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxmi_Narayan_Temple,_Pushkar)",

The story begins with the sage Agastya, who was performing penance on the banks of the Godavari River. One day, a demon named Bhandasura came to the river and began to terrorize the people. Agastya tried to reason with Bhandasura, but the demon refused to listen. Finally, Agastya was forced to kill Bhandasura.\n\nAfter killing Bhandasura, Agastya decided to build a temple to Shiva, the god of destruction. He chose a hilltop near the Godavari River as the site for the temple. Agastya then began to dig a pit for the foundation of the temple. However, as he dug, he found that the pit was bottomless. Agastya realized that this was a sign from Shiva, who did not want the temple to be built.\n\nAgastya was disappointed, but he knew that he had to obey Shiva's wishes. He abandoned the project and left the hilltop. However, Shiva was impressed by Agastya's devotion and decided to bless him. Shiva appeared to Agastya and told him that he would build the temple himself. Shiva then created a Shivalinga out of sand and installed it on the hilltop.\n\nThe Shivalinga that Shiva created is said to be the oldest in the world. It is also said to be one of the most powerful. The temple that was built around the Shivalinga is known as Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple.\n\n* **Significance**\n\nSri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple is one of the most important temples in India.

The gods and demons decided to churn the ocean of milk in order to obtain amrita, the nectar of immortality. Mount Mandara was used as the churning stick, and Vasuki, the king of the serpents, was used as the rope. The gods pulled on Vasuki's head, while the demons pulled on his tail. After churning for a lng time, they finally obtained amrita. However, before the gods could drink it, the demons stole it. The gods then appealed to Vishnu for help. Vishnu took the form of Mohini, the most beautiful woman in the universe. Mohini tricked the demons into drinking a potion that turned them into stone. The gods then drank the amrita and became immortal.\n\n* **The Birth of Goddess Yamuna:**\n\nAfter the gods had become immortal, they decided to divide the amrita among themselves. However, a few drops of amrita fell to the ground. These drops of amrita became the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. Goddess Yamuna was born from the drops of amrita that fell on the earth.
